Sarap Local — Demo (Static, localStorage-based)

How to run with XAMPP:
1) Extract this folder to: C:\xampp\htdocs\sarap_local
2) Start Apache in XAMPP Control Panel.
3) Open your browser and go to: http://localhost/sarap_local/login.html

Notes:
- This demo uses localStorage (data is saved in your browser). Clearing site data will remove posts.
- To test as a vendor, go to the Vendor page, set your Vendor Name (top), then create posts.
- Customer page lets you search, filter by availability, comment, and send messages.
- Vendor page shows comments and messages for your posts, and lets you edit, toggle availability, or delete posts.
- Image uploads are stored as Data URLs in localStorage; large images may increase storage size.
- Next step (optional): convert this into a real PHP/MySQL app so multiple devices can share data.
